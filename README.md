# ML-Football-Predictions

What ive Done:

Cleaned data on premier league matches getting it ready for machine learning
Created initial machine learning with just a few predictors and a target
trained random forest model to operate on set of predictors and computed precision score.
Improved accurary by generating more predictors and training model again using rolling averages.
Then improved precision again by comparing both sides of a match.
ended up with 67.5% precision on predicting wins.

Ways to further improve:

Use data from more seasons, use more of columns to generate predictions e.g referee, captain etc, different ML algorithm e.g neural network or any other
algorithm that can pick up non linear tendencies, integrate additional data e.g. games played outside of premier league and also overall team record and opponent record over the season.
